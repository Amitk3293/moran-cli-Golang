This is a command line interface (CLI) tool created using Golang and Cobra. It allows the user to set and manage reminders.

Usage
To use the CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
./<executable-file-name> reminder -s "reminder text" -m "slack message"
The reminder command is used to set and manage reminders.

The -s or --set flag is used to set a reminder. The reminder text should be provided as a string following the flag.

The -m or --message flag is used to send a message to Slack. The message should be provided as a string following the flag.

Config
The CLI uses a YAML file for configuration. The file should be located in the config directory and named config.yaml. The file should contain the following:

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: <your-webhook-url>


Replace <your-webhook-url> with the URL of the webhook for your Slack channel.

Reminders Storage
The CLI stores the reminders in an SQLite3 database file named reminders.db. The file is created in the same directory as the executable file.

The reminders are stored in a table named reminders with the following columns: id, text, datetime. The id column is the primary key and text and datetime cannot be null.

Error handling
If there is an error while running the command, the error message will be printed in the terminal.

If there is an error sending the slack message, the error message will be printed in the terminal.

If there is an error reading the config file or parsing it, the error message will be printed in the terminal.

If there is an error opening or creating the database file, the error message will be printed in the terminal.

Additional information
In the above script, you can see that the reminder command accepts two flags, one is to set the reminder text and another is to send the slack message. This command is defined in the reminderCmd variable, which is of type cobra.Command. And the function storeReminder() is used to store the reminders in sqlite3 database. The function runSlackCommand() is used to send message to slack channel.
It also reads the configuration from the config.yaml file, this file should be located in the config directory, and should contain the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL key and value of the webhook url of your slack channel.
It uses the sqlite3 driver to interact with the sqlite3 database and yaml package to read the config file.
